# quantum-dynamics-
This project simulates the time evolution of a qubit using the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP). It models quantum state dynamics under various Hamiltonians and includes the effects of decoherence and relaxation using the Lindblad master equation.  The simulation visualizes Rabi oscillations, Bloch vector motion, and expectation values.
