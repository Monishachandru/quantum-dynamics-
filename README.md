This project simulates the time evolution of a qubit using the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP). It models quantum state dynamics under various Hamiltonians and includes the effects of decoherence and relaxation using the Lindblad master equation.  The simulation visualizes Rabi oscillations, Bloch vector motion, and expectation values.

# ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Dynamics with QuTiP

This project simulates the **time evolution of a qubit** using the **Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP)**.  
It models how quantum states evolve under different **Hamiltonians**, showing effects like **Rabi oscillations**, **decoherence**, and **relaxation** using the **Lindblad master equation**.

## üß© Features
- Simulates **unitary evolution** (closed quantum systems)
- Models **open system dynamics** with decoherence (T‚ÇÅ, TœÜ)
- Solves the **Schr√∂dinger** and **Lindblad master equations**
- Plots **expectation values** of Pauli operators:
  - ‚ü®œÉx‚ü©, ‚ü®œÉy‚ü©, ‚ü®œÉz‚ü© vs time
- Visualizes **quantum coherence decay**

## üß† What It Demonstrates
This simulation represents a **single spin-¬Ω particle (qubit)** in a magnetic field.  
It shows how a qubit's state evolves over time ‚Äî rotating on the **Bloch sphere** and gradually losing coherence due to interaction with the environment.

Physically, this is equivalent to observing the dynamics of:
- an electron spin in a magnetic field,
- or a superconducting qubit driven by microwave pulses.
